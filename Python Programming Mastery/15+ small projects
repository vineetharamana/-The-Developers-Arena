====write a program that tackes a string input from the user and counts the number of cowels(A,E,I,O,U, and their lowercase equivalents) in the string.
s = input()
s2 = s.lower()
a = s2.count('a')
e = s2.count('e')
i = s2.count('i')
o = s2.count('o')
u = s2.count('u')
print(f"Number of vowels:{a+e+i+o+u}")
output---Hello, World!
Number of vowels:3

====create a program that tackes the marks of a student in different subjects as input.Calculate the total marks and average,and then display the corresponding grade based on the average.
m = int(input("Marks in Math: "))
s = int(input("Marks in Science: "))
e = int(input("Marks in English: "))

total_marks = m+e+s
average = total_marks/3

percentage = (total_marks/300)*100
grade = ""
if percentage > 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif percentage > 80 and percentage<=90:
    grade = 'B'
elif percentage > 70 and percentage<=80:
    grade = 'c'
else:
    grade = "p"

print(f"Total Marks: {total_marks} \n Average Marks: {average} \n Grade: {grade}")
output--->Marks in Math: 85
Marks in Science: 90
Marks in English: 78
Total Marks: 253 
 Average Marks: 84.33333333333333 
 Grade: B

====write a program that takes a string input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome or not.A palindrome is a word,pharase,number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.
s = input("Give a string: ")

reverse = s[::-1]
if reverse == s:
    print("It is a palidrome.")
else:
    print("It is not a palidrome.")
output--->Give a string: mars
It is not a palidrome.

===write a program that tackes three numbers as input and finds the argest among them using desiciuon making statements.
