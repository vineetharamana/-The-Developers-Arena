====write a program that tackes a string input from the user and counts the number of cowels(A,E,I,O,U, and their lowercase equivalents) in the string.
s = input()
s2 = s.lower()
a = s2.count('a')
e = s2.count('e')
i = s2.count('i')
o = s2.count('o')
u = s2.count('u')
print(f"Number of vowels:{a+e+i+o+u}")
output---Hello, World!
Number of vowels:3
