===Function===
function are blocks of organised,reusable codethat perform specific task.Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.
-you define a function using the def keyword,followed by the function name,parentheses(),and a colon:
syntax
def function_name(parameters):
   #function body
===function call===
the execute a function and run the code inside it,you call the function by using its name followed by parentheses().
syntax
function_name(arguments)
===parameters and arguments===
functions can take input values known as parameters or arguments.
parameters are defined in the function's parentheses during the function definition.
Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called
===keyword arguments===
you can pass arguments to a function using their names expicity, known as keyword arguments.this allows you to pass arguments in any order.
===default arguments===
default arguments are used to provide default values for parameters in case no value is passed during the function call.if no argument is provided for a default parameter,the default value will be used.
===recursive function===
base case:the base case is the condition that specifies when the function should stop calling itself and return a result directly.it acts as the stopping criterion for the recursion,preventing infinite recursion.Recursive case=
recursive case: the recursive case is the part of the function that calls itself with a modified version of the input,leading to smaller instances of the same problem.
===lambda function===
is a small,one-line function that can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression.
syntax
lambda arguments:expression
