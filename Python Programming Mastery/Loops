===Loops===
loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condotion is true or for a specific number of iterations
===types===
-->while    ---->for
===while loop===
the while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.it continuously checks the condition before each iteration and steps when the condition becomes false
syntax:
while condition:
 # code block to be executed repeatedly
===for loop===
A for loop is a way to repeat a block of code for each item in a collection(like a list) or for a specific range of numbers.
syntax:
for variable in range(start,stop,step)
  # code block to be executed for each variable
===nested loops===
nested loops refer to the situation where one loop is placed inside another loop.this allows you to execute a set of indtructions repeatedly.
syntax:
for outer_var in outer_sequence:
 #code block of the outer loop
for inner_var in inner_sequence:
 #code block of the inner loop
===break===
if during the execution of the loop python interpreter encounters break,it immediatly stops the oop execution and exits out of it.
syntax:
while condition:
 #code block inside the loop
if same_condition:
 break #exit the loop if the condition is met
===continue===
continue statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration immediately
syntax:
while condition:
 #code block inside the loop
 if some_condition:
      continue #skip this iteration
